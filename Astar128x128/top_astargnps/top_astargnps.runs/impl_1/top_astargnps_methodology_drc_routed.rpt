TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock clk_wiz_0_i/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin clk_wiz_0_i/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)

One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
